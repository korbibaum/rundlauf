Certainly, here's a summary of the key technical aspects discussed for your project:

**Frontend Framework and Libraries:**

- Consider using React, Vue.js, or similar frameworks for the frontend.
- Utilize UI libraries like Material-UI, Vuetify, or free alternatives.
- Employ animation libraries like Framer Motion, Animate.css, or GSAP for creating animations.

**Backend:**

- Use a lightweight web server, such as Flask or Express.js.
- Create a RESTful API to manage data and real-time updates.
- Implement WebSocket for real-time communication.
- Choose a lightweight database like SQLite.
- Ensure security measures and access controls.

**Local Deployment:**

- Host the app locally on a Raspberry Pi or a powerful microcontroller.
- Consider using a Raspberry Pi as a server for both the backend and frontend.
- Set up monitoring and management tools for the local deployment.

**Character Animation:**

- Choose 2D or 3D graphics libraries or engines based on your character requirements.
- Create or source 3D models and rig them for animations.
- Implement animation logic for character behavior.
- Consider using game engines for complex character interactions.

**UI and Interface:**

- Design a user interface (UI) for character interaction.
- Implement responsive design for various devices and screen sizes.
- Include features for real-time updates and user interactions.

**Optimization and Performance:**

- Optimize code and assets for smooth performance, especially on resource-constrained platforms like a Raspberry Pi.

**Networking (Optional):**

- Implement networking, like WebSockets or WebRTC, for real-time communication between users' devices, if needed.

**Testing and Iteration:**

- Continuously test and iterate on character behavior and interactions.

These technical aspects cover the development of your app, from frontend and backend to character animation and deployment, to create an engaging and interactive experience similar to the Wii lobby.
